## Create your own Slack workspace

1. Assume you already have a Slack account.
1. https://slack.com/create
1. Enter the email address you use for Slack
1. Recieve email and enter confirmation number.
1. Name your "team" - will be the initial default workspace name. yourteam.slack.com
1. Name your project - this will become a default channel
1. Add team mates or skip for now to work solo
1. View your new workspace in the browser application.

You will be prompted to finish signing up.

1. Set your name and password, and check whether or not to allow Slack to email you. Click next.
1. Change your workspace name and Slack URL to something else if you'd like. Click next.
1. Provide the email addresses of people you would like to invite, or generate an invite link. This is optional, click finish when you're done.

Your workspace is all set! Slackbot will introduce itself and you can poke around and play with whatever you like.

If you use the Slack desktop app and want to add your workspace there:

1. Click the + plus sign button on the far left side of the app, or choose "Sign in to another workspace" from the sidebar dropdown menu or the `Window` drop down in the toolbar.
1. No matter which method you chose, you will be directed to https://slack.com/ssb/add -- enter your workspace URL as prompted.
1. If you aren't logged into your workspace on Slack's website, you will be asked for the email address and password tied to this workspace.
1. You should then be prompted to open the workspace in the Slack desktop application.

A quick note on adding the workspace to your Slack mobile app:
You should be able to access your workspaces on your mobile app by tapping the icon that looks 4 squares ina 2x2 formation. The onscreen instructions should make it fairly obvious how to add the workspace from there.
